<!-- <SD-DOCS> -->

**Tracing Module** provides a tracing stack for the [SIGHUP Distribution (SD)][kfd-repo].

If you are new to SD please refer to the [official documentation][kfd-docs] on how to get started with SD.

## Overview

**Tracing Module** uses a collection of open source tools to provide the most resilient and robust tracing stack for the cluster.

The module contains the [tempo][tempo-page] tool from grafana.

All the components are deployed in the `tracing` namespace in the cluster.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

| Tool                        | Version    | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [furyctl][furyctl-repo]     | `>=0.25.0` | The recommended tool to download and manage SD modules and their packages. To learn more about `furyctl` read the [official documentation][furyctl-repo].     |
| [kustomize][kustomize-repo] | `>=3.5.3`  | Packages are customized using `kustomize`. To learn how to create your customization layer with `kustomize`, please refer to the [repository][kustomize-repo]. |

### Deployment

Include the tracing module configuration in your `furyctl.yaml` file, specifically under the `spec.distribution.modules.tracing` section. This streamlined approach enhances the deployment process by seamlessly integrating with the SIGHUP Distribution management tools.

Here is an example snippet for the `furyctl.yaml` file that demonstrates how to configure the tracing module with Tempo as the tracing system and High Availability (HA) MinIO instance for storage:

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      tracing:
        type: tempo
        minio:
          storageSize: "20Gi"
```

#### Sending Traces to Tempo

To send traces form an instrumented application to Tempo, point the application to the Distributor's service:

```plaintext
tempo-distributed-distributor.tracing.svc.cluster.local:4317/

> [!NOTE]
> `4317` is the port for the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), the Distributor supports other protocols but it is recommended to use OTLP for performance reasons.

> [!WARNING]
> For production workloads, it is better to use something like the [OpenTelemetry Collector][otel-collector] instead of pushing the traces directly to Tempo, so the application can oflload the traces quickly and minimize impact on the application's performance.

### Legacy Deployment

1. List the packages you want to deploy and their version in a `Furyfile.yml`

```yaml
bases:
  - name: tracing
    version: "v1.3.0"
```

> See `furyctl` [documentation][furyctl-repo] for additional details about `Furyfile.yml` format.

2. Execute `furyctl legacy vendor -H` to download the packages

3. Inspect the download packages under `./vendor/katalog/tracing`.

4. Define a `kustomization.yaml` that includes the `./vendor/katalog/tracing` directory as resource.

```yaml
resources:
- ./vendor/katalog/tracing/minio-ha
- ./vendor/katalog/tracing/tempo-distributed
```

5. To deploy the packages to your cluster, execute:

```bash
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```

> Note: When installing the packages, you need to ensure that the Prometheus operator is also installed.
> Otherwise, the API server will reject all ServiceMonitor resources.
